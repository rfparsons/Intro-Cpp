bobbysqYesterday at 3:48 PM
Though I think we'd have to basically go with another team to have enough people
But I really want to see what FRC gameplay looks like at 3 am
Ch'Boy TomYesterday at 3:49 PM
is there a requisite number of people or is asap to small to support competitions rn?
bobbysqYesterday at 3:49 PM
Not 26 hour straight competitions
Ch'Boy TomYesterday at 3:49 PM
sleep is for cowards
i've done 26 hour straight competitions multiple times trust me its possible
especially for spry high schoolers with adrenaline and caffeine

WVROX is going to be ridiculously hard to get in to... like I would not be surprised one bit if 3-10x the number of teams to get in actually hope to apply.
But yeah WVROX would be insanely fun if it isn't canceled
